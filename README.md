Well, the time is finally here. AI is going to take over. So, I figured, why not make a few funny dog images, throw some dog clothes on them, and call it an e-shop?

Welcome to **The Doggo Apparel E-Shop**, a revolutionary online store (not really) where you can buy dog clothes that are way fancier than your own wardrobe. Powered by Next.js, because hey, if it’s good enough for dog clothes, it’s good enough for everything else.

## Features

- **Dog Clothes** – Yes, dogs wear clothes now. No, they don’t like it. But who cares? They look adorable.
- **AI-Generated Content** – Because nothing says "quality" like AI-generated descriptions of dog jackets.
- **Smooth UX/UI** – Thanks to Next.js. It’s so smooth, even your dog would be impressed (if they could understand UX).
- **Fast and Reliable** – Faster than your dog running after a squirrel.

## How It Works

1. You (the human) browse our collection of stylish dog apparel.
2. You buy it, and your dog pretends to hate it.
3. Your dog looks _way too good_ in it, and you post it on Instagram.
4. We all pretend it was worth the struggle.
